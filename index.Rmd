Narrative: Clear narrative description of the data sources and methods. Includes data from at least two sources that were integrated / merged in R.

Code: The code associated with the project is well organized and easy to follow. Demonstrates mastery of R graphics and functions.

Data: The underlying data are publicly accessible via the web and downloaded/accessed within the Rmd script. If you want to use your own data, you must make it available on a website (e.g. Figshare) so that others are able to re-run your code.

You can do bullets like this:

* The first most important thing
* The second most important thing
* The third most important thing

You can do numbers like this:

1. The first most important thing
2. The second most important thin
3. The third most important thing
